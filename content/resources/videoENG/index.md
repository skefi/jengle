## Biodiversity: all different but all linked to each other

You, me, the bird, the ladybug, the poppy, we are all connected and we are the biodiversity. 

Here is a 3 minutes [educational video](https://youtu.be/v8qU83Y6ugo) explaining the concept of inter-relationships in nature. 

Biodiversity is a story of species but also of links! It is these interdepencies in nature that allow us to understand the functioning of ecological communities and their responses to disturbances.
